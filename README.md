# Triangle Calculator Website - Project Summary

## Overview
This project is a responsive, interactive triangle calculator website built with React and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to enter any combination of triangle sides and angles (with at least 3 values including 1 side), calculates the remaining values, and renders a visual representation of the triangle.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Modern, Responsive Interface
- Clean, professional design with student-friendly colors
- Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Interactive elements with subtle animations
- Accessible navigation and form controls

### 2. Triangle Calculator
- Input fields for all sides (a, b, c) and angles (α, β, γ)
- Real-time validation with clear error messages
- Support for all triangle cases (SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS, SSA)
- Calculation of all triangle properties (sides, angles, area, perimeter)
- Triangle type identification (scalene, isosceles, equilateral)

### 3. Visual Triangle Drawing
- SVG-based triangle visualization that scales automatically
- Accurate representation of calculated triangle
- Clear labels for sides, angles, and vertices
- Responsive drawing that adapts to different screen sizes

### 4. Educational Resources
- Comprehensive help page with usage instructions
- Explanations of trigonometric laws (Law of Sines, Law of Cosines)
- FAQ section addressing common questions

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- React single-page application
- Component-based structure for modularity and reusability
- Custom triangle calculation utilities
- SVG-based drawing component

### Key Files and Directories
- `/src/pages/` - Main page components
- `/src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `/src/utils/` - Triangle calculation logic
- `/public/` - Static assets

### Technologies Used
- React 18
- React Router for navigation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- SVG for triangle visualization
- JavaScript Math library for calculations

## Usage Instructions

### Development
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

### Deployment
The site can be deployed to any static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.) by uploading the build directory contents after running `npm run build`.

## Future Enhancements
- Add option to save/export triangle data
- Implement animation for triangle transformations
- Add more geometric calculations (medians, altitudes, etc.)
- Create a gallery of common triangle types
- Add unit conversion functionality
